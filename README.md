SFXScout v0.9.0 — Friends & Family Preview

This is a friends + family preview of SFXScout, a macOS app for browsing and searching your local SFX library with fast auditioning.

Expect rough edges—this release is primarily to validate the core workflow and collect feedback.

What’s new / what to test 
* Local library browsing (point SFXScout at one or more folders)
* Fast search across filenames + metadata/tags (designed for “type → find → play” speed)
* Instant auditioning (quick preview controls for rapid selection)
* Tagging + favorites (light organization to speed up repeat use)
* Export / copy path workflow (get sounds into your edit workflow faster)

Quick start
* Download the release asset (DMG/ZIP), install the app, launch it.
* On first launch, add your SFX folder(s).
* Wait for the initial index/build (time depends on library size).
* Search, preview, favorite, tag, and try exporting/using in your normal workflow.

Known limitations (v0.9)
* First-run indexing may take a while on large libraries.
* Metadata/tagging is intentionally minimal and may evolve quickly.
* UI polish and edge-case handling are still in progress (you may hit bugs).

Feedback I want (copy/paste friendly)
* What was your library size (roughly) and how long did indexing take?
* Did search results feel “right” for your queries?
* Any crashes / glitches? What were you doing right before it happened?
* What’s the #1 feature you expected to exist but didn’t?

Report issues / feedback Message/email me directly with steps to reproduce + macOS version + your library size.

Privacy
* SFXScout is designed to run locally. Your audio stays on your machine.

What’s next
* Onboarding/help improvements
* Better tagging + organization tools
* Duplicate detection + smarter metadata (later “AI-assisted” features)
